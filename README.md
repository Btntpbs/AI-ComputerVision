# AI and Computer Vision Tasks

This repository contains implementations for Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision laboratory tasks, focusing on maze-solving algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and A*.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to implement and document AI algorithms for solving mazes. The implementation includes meaningful comments and descriptive variable names for better understanding and reusability. The solutions are implemented in Python using the OpenCV framework.

## Tasks Implemented

### Task 1: Depth-First Search (DFS) Maze Solver
- **Objective**: Solve the maze using DFS.
- **Features**:
  - Displays the original maze.
  - Visualizes the solution path with `*`.
  - Preserves the goal marker `G`.
  
### Task 2: A* Maze Solver with Path Costs
- **Objective**: Solve the maze using the A* algorithm with path costs.
- **Features**:
  - Displays the optimal path from start `S` to goal `G`.
  - Visualizes cumulative path costs for each cell.
